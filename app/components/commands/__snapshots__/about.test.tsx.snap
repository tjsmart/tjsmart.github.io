    Hi there 👋! I'm Tyler, a software engineer with a passion
                    for creating innovative solutions. With over 8 years of
                    experience in Python 🐍, I possess a deep knowledge of its
                    standard library, typing system, popular third-party
                    packages, C ABI, and packaging system. My background is in
                    physics ⚛️, specifically a PhD with a focus on using
                    computational physics for predicting quantum mechanical
                    properties of materials, has equipped me with a unique
                    perspective in leveraging technology for quantum information
                    and quantum computation 🌠.

    In my current role as a technical lead at Solidigm/Intel, I play a crucial role in developing cutting-edge validation tools for solid-state drives 💾. My diverse skill set 💫 extends beyond Python, encompassing expertise in technologies like C/C++, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, HTML/CSS, Docker, Unix, and Git.

    On this website, you'll find examples of my work, ranging
                    from elegant Python code to sophisticated quantum
                    simulations. Join me 🙌 on this journey as we explore the
                    fascinating world of software engineering, computational
                    physics, and more!
